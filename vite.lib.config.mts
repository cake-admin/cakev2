/**
 * Library build for the publishable design-system package (@cake-admin/cakeand).
 *
 * This is deliberately separate from the app's Create React App build and from
 * `.storybook/main.ts` — it only compiles `src/cakeand` into a distributable,
 * and never touches the site build.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Every runtime dependency the consumer also owns is EXTERNAL. styled-components
 *    especially must stay a singleton: two copies in one app means two separate
 *    ThemeProviders/stylesheets and components silently lose their theme.
 *  - CSS is emitted as one file (`cakeand.css`) that carries the token layer and
 *    the @font-face rules; `scripts/build-package.mjs` then prepends an import of
 *    it to the entry so consumers get styles without a second import.
 *  - The Rookery woff2 files are emitted to `assets/` and their URLs rewritten,
 *    which is why fonts.css references them relatively.
