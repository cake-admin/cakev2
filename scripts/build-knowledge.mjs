/**
 * Emits cake& component knowledge as schema-conforming JSON for the AI Lab
 * knowledge base (github.com/cake-admin/ai-lab).
 *
 *   node scripts/build-knowledge.mjs --out ../ai-lab/knowledge/components
 *
 * THIS IS A FORWARDER. The generator now lives in scripts/build-agent-context.mjs,
 * which produces the JSON here and the markdown that coding agents read from a
 * SINGLE parse of the story docs — so the two can never describe the components
 * differently. This entry point is kept because it is the documented workflow in
 * Publishing.mdx and in ai-lab, and because `--out` reads better than
 * `--json-out` when JSON is all you want.
 *
 * Behaviour is unchanged, including the rule that matters most: an existing
 * *.cake.json is NEVER overwritten, so hand-curated entries survive a resync.
