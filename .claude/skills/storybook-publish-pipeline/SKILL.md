  How cake& Storybook and the npm package reach production after component

# cake& Storybook + package publish pipeline

Component work is not done when the local Storybook looks right. This skill
is the release path: what updates automatically, what must be triggered by
hand, and what CI must prove on the PR.

## What updates automatically (GitHub Pages)

Merging to `main` runs **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
That job builds the CRA site **and** Storybook, then publishes:

- Site → `https://cake.lenovo.com/`
- Storybook → `https://cake.lenovo.com/storybook/`

Every `src/cakeand/` change that lands on `main` is live on Storybook after
that deploy. There is no separate “publish Storybook” step.

## What does **not** update automatically (npm)

The design-system package `@cake-admin/cakeand` publishes **only** from
**Actions → Publish design system package** (`.github/workflows/main.yml`),
which is `workflow_dispatch`. Merging to `main` never publishes npm.

Do **not** wire package publish to `push` / `pull_request`. A Storybook-only
fix must not mint a version.

### How to ship a package version

1. Confirm the work is on `main` (or will be, before you run the workflow).
2. Choose the **next semver** (`1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, …). Never reuse a tag.
3. Run **Publish design system package** with that `version`.
4. Leave **dry_run** checked on the first pass. Inspect the job summary
   (manifest, tarball name). Re-run with dry_run **unchecked** to publish.
5. The workflow:
   - rejects non-semver and any version **older than or equal to** the latest
     `v*` tag (the Release asset URL is immutable)
   - creates tag `vX.Y.Z` + GitHub Release tarball
     `cake-admin-cakeand-X.Y.Z.tgz`
   - publishes GitHub Packages
   - opens a PR pinning `starter/` to that Release URL and regenerating
     `starter/context/` (never hand-edit that folder)

If tags such as `v4.2.2` already exist, `1.0.0` will fail the guard. Either
publish the next 4.x, or treat “Cake& 1.0” as marketing copy while npm stays
on the 4.x line — do not delete and reuse a tag.

## Before you open the PR

Follow **storybook-component-docs** for anything under
`src/cakeand/components/`. Additional pipeline rules:

- A **new component folder** must be added to `CATEGORIES` in
  `scripts/build-agent-context.mjs`. A folder missing from that map is a
  component agents will never use. Same-folder additions (Calendar next to
  DateInput) do not need a new category.
- Run Storybook via the package scripts (this repo path contains `&`, which
  breaks `npx` shims on Windows):

  ```bash
  npm run storybook          # dev, port 6006
  npm run build-storybook    # static build; then remove storybook-static
  ```

- Do **not** hand-edit `starter/context/`. It is generated at publish time.

## Consumer docs (designers downloading the kit)

If the **install path** changes (degit, giget, Release `.tgz` URL, peer
deps, `CakeProvider`, `cake:update`), update these three surfaces in the
same PR. They are written for designers who may be new to development —
numbered steps, plain language, what each command does.

1. **Storybook** — [Introduction.mdx](../../../src/cakeand/foundations/Introduction.mdx)
   (short “Use cake&”) and
   [GettingStarted.mdx](../../../src/cakeand/foundations/GettingStarted.mdx)
   (full walkthrough).
2. **Site** — the Cake& Devkit card on
   [Resources.js](../../../src/pages/Resources.js). CTA stays
   `STORYBOOK_PATH?path=/docs/introduction--docs` (instructions, not a raw
   GitHub clone). Keep `MEDIA_GRADIENTS.devkit` in sync with Figma
   `gradient/ui/blue alt` (`#004e5e` → `#3b92f9`, 12.3deg).
3. **GitHub** — root [README.md](../../../README.md) **Use it** / **Updating**.
   Do not invent a third tutorial. Do not hardcode a version in the tarball
   URL (`vX.Y.Z`). Touch `starter/README.md` only if commands would drift.

Storybook on cake.lenovo.com updates on merge. The npm kit designers install
does **not** until **Publish design system package** runs.

## CI on the PR

PRs that touch `src/cakeand/**` or `.storybook/**` run
`.github/workflows/storybook.yml`:

1. `npm run build-storybook` — the docs site that Pages will nest
2. `npm run build:package` + `npm pack --dry-run` in `dist-package/` — the
   tarball the Publish workflow would ship

A red Storybook build means `main` would fail Pages. A red pack means the
next version cannot publish. Fix those on the PR; do not merge around them.

## After merge

- Wait for **Deploy to GitHub Pages** to go green, then confirm
  `https://cake.lenovo.com/storybook/` shows the change (Introduction **Use
  cake&** and the Resources Devkit card if you changed either).
- If this change should be installable (`npm install` the Release tarball),
  run **Publish design system package** as above. Storybook being live is
  not the same as a new package version.
